# dysregulated-DNBs
As a dynamical system, complex disease always has a sudden state transition at the tipping point, which is the result of the long-term accumulation of abnormal regulations. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect the early-warning signals of influenza A (H3N2 and H1N1) outbreaks by dysregulated dynamic network biomarkers (dysregulated DNBs) for individuals. The results of cross-validation show that our approach can detect early-warning signals before the symptom appears successfully. Unlike the traditional DNBs, our dysregulated DNBs are anchored and very few, which is essential for disease early diagnosis in clinical practice. Moreover, the genes of dysregulated DNBs are significantly enriched in the influenza-related pathways.
